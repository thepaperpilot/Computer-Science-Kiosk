Computer-Science-Kiosk
======================
This is an open source program for a kiosk that will teach students the basics of computer science.
It was initiated as a part of Anthony Lawn's Eagle Scout Project, which was to build such a kiosk to place in the Quail Valley Middle School library.

More information about the program can be seen in the design documents.
