				"something happen, but don’t truly give you the flexibility and power given by other" +
				"programming languages. So after you have mastered making Scratch programs, " +
				"it is time to learn \'true\' programming. First thing to do is choose which programming language " +
				"you want to focus. The two most common programming languages are C++ and Java. Both of " +
				"these languages have free downloadable compilers and are easy to learn and use to create games " +
				"and other programs simple and advanced. Of these, Java is more highly recommended for beginners, " +
				"and is what the AP test will assess you over. The first program people write is a simple “Hello " +
				"World” program, which is used to simply get a beginning feel of how to use the programming " +
				"language. After writing the “Hello World” program it is time to move onto writing programs. " +
				"There are many tools online and courses that are easy and free to take. Two of the better known" +
				"resources are code.org and codecademy.com, although neither focus on Java. Fortunately, in " +
				"most nearby high schools there are courses over Computer Science that do go over java. So, go" +
				"have fun; find out what interests you, and follow along, and you can become skilled with programming," +
				"opening doors into the fastest expanding industry of the century.");
